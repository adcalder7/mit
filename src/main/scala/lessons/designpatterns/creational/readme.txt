Deal with object creations. It hides the complexities in creating objects

When creating objects, complexities are:

    1. The number of initialization parameters
    2. Required validation
    3. The complexity of acquiring the required parameters

Order

    1. StaticFactory
    2. SimpleFactory
    3. FactoryMethod
    4. AbstractFactory

AbstractFactory and FactoryMethod are the same... vanilla example of composition vs inheritance
